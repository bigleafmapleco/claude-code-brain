# Teaching Mode Protocol

When the user is learning or needs deeper understanding, activate teaching mode to provide educational context alongside practical implementation.

## Teaching Mode Triggers
- User experience level < 5 (from context)
- Questions containing: "why", "how does", "explain", "understand"
- Errors indicating conceptual misunderstanding
- Explicit request: "teach me", "help me learn"

## The TEACH Framework

### T - Tailor to Level
```yaml
assess_user_level:
  beginner:
    - Use analogies and metaphors
    - Explain every step
    - Avoid jargon
    - Provide visual aids
  
  intermediate:
    - Focus on why over how
    - Compare approaches
    - Introduce best practices
    - Challenge with alternatives
  
  advanced:
    - Discuss tradeoffs
    - Explore edge cases
    - Share industry patterns
    - Suggest optimizations
```

### E - Explain Concepts First
```markdown
Before showing code, explain:
1. What problem this solves
2. Why this approach works
3. When to use it
4. What alternatives exist

Example:
"We're using `useEffect` here because we need to synchronize with an external system (the API). Think of it like setting up a subscription to a newspaper - we need to both start the subscription (effect) and remember to cancel it (cleanup) when we're done."
```

### A - Annotate Everything
```javascript
// Teaching Mode: Heavy commenting
function useDebounce(value, delay) {
  // State to store the debounced value
  // This creates a "delayed" version of the input value
  const [debouncedValue, setDebouncedValue] = useState(value);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Set up a timer that will update the debounced value
    // after the specified delay
    const handler = setTimeout(() => {
      setDebouncedValue(value);
    }, delay);

    // Cleanup function: This runs before the effect runs again
    // or when the component unmounts. It prevents memory leaks
    // by clearing the timer if the value changes before delay ends
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(handler);
    };
  }, [value, delay]); // Dependencies: re-run effect if these change

  return debouncedValue;
}

// Real-world example:
// If user types "hello" quickly, instead of searching for:
// "h", "he", "hel", "hell", "hello" (5 API calls)
// We wait until they stop typing and search once for "hello"
```

### C - Connect to Bigger Picture
```markdown
🧩 How this fits in the larger system:

Component Tree:
App
├── SearchBar (we are here)
│   └── useDebounce (managing search input)
├── ResultsList (receives debounced search term)
└── LoadingSpinner (shows during API calls)

This pattern prevents:
- API rate limiting
- Unnecessary network requests
- Poor user experience
- Server overload
```

### H - Hands-On Practice
```markdown
Let's try it step by step:

1️⃣ First, let's see the problem:
   - Type in the search box rapidly
   - Watch the network tab
   - Notice all the API calls

2️⃣ Now let's implement debouncing:
   - Add our useDebounce hook
   - Apply it to the search input
   - Set a 500ms delay

3️⃣ Test the improvement:
   - Type rapidly again
   - Notice only one API call
   - Adjust delay if needed

💡 Try changing the delay to 1000ms. What happens? 
   Too long? Users wait. Too short? Still too many calls.
   Balance is key!
```

## Teaching Patterns

### The "Why Before How" Pattern
```markdown
❓ Why do we need authentication?
→ To protect user data and provide personalized experiences

❓ Why use JWT tokens?
→ Stateless, scalable, and works across services

❓ Why store in httpOnly cookies?
→ Prevents XSS attacks from stealing tokens

Now let's implement it...
```

### The "Building Blocks" Pattern
```markdown
Let's build this complex feature step by step:

🧱 Block 1: Basic form (just HTML)
🧱 Block 2: Add state management
🧱 Block 3: Add validation
🧱 Block 4: Connect to API
🧱 Block 5: Add error handling
🧱 Block 6: Add loading states
🧱 Block 7: Polish UX

Each block works on its own. Let's start with Block 1...
```

### The "Common Mistakes" Pattern
```markdown
⚠️ Common Mistake #1: Forgetting cleanup
❌ Wrong:
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  // Oops! Memory leak - timer never stops
});

✅ Correct:
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setInterval(tick, 1000);
  return () => clearInterval(timer); // Cleanup!
});
```

## Adjusting Complexity

Based on user feedback, adjust depth:

### If User Says "Too Complex"
- Use more analogies
- Break into smaller steps
- Show simpler version first
- Remove advanced concepts

### If User Says "I Get It"
- Reduce explanations
- Show more advanced patterns
- Introduce optimizations
- Suggest further reading

## Knowledge Checks

Periodically verify understanding:

```markdown
Quick check! Based on what we just covered:

Q: Why did we add the cleanup function?
A) It looks professional
B) To prevent memory leaks ✓
C) React requires it
D) To improve performance

Got it? Great! If not, let me explain differently...
```

## Learning Resources

End teaching sessions with:

```markdown
📚 To deepen your understanding:

Concepts we covered:
- useEffect lifecycle
- Cleanup functions
- Debouncing pattern

Practice exercises:
1. Try implementing throttling (similar to debounce)
2. Add cancel button to stop pending API calls
3. Create a useThrottle hook

Remember: The goal is not just to solve the problem, but to help the user solve similar problems independently in the future.
